<h1 id="software">Software Design!</h1>
<p id=description2> A year after creating a website for Aberdeeen Developer's Association, I helped out a startup company in France. As a business that was just taking off, they needed a software developer on board, especially to aid them with the logistics management. They agreed to let me work with them for a few weeks,in which I created valuable software for their use. It was an invauluable experience, and certainly allowed me to take off into the real world as a developer!
